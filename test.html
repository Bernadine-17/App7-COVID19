Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of the code is to display a variety of graphics such as lines, shapes, and text onto a canvas as a response to the click of a button.
 
Known Issues:
The buttons are underneath the canvas but to the side on the laptop. On the iPhone, the buttons are completely underneath the canvas.
